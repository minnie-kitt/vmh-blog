    "text": "This blog was started in June 2025 as a way to break down findings from my thesis, into bite-sized chunks of information.\n\nVeterinary Feelings\nVeterinary medicine is an undeniably emotional profession. Veterinarians are subject to emotional distress on a regular basis, whether that is their own emotions —perhaps brought by the inevitable failure to save a patient— or the clients’ emotions, such as losing a beloved pet. With this constant exposure to extremely emotional situations, it’s no wonder that many veterinarians experience empathic distress, eventually leading to burnout and, in some cases, leaving the profession.\nIn 2022-2023, I interviewed 21 early-career veterinarians in Canada, asking them about emotional experiences in their clinical practice as part of my doctoral thesis research, now published as the article, “A qualitative exploration of the emotional experiences and applications of emotional intelligence in early-career veterinarians”.\n“Veterinary Feelings” is the first series of blog posts which I translate the findings from this article, into a less academic and more reader-friendly experience.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Over 40 years and potentially hundreds of published studies later, what have we learned? And, more importantly, where are we headed next?\n\n\n\nFirstly, we’ve learned the common “adverse mental health outcomes” associated with being a veterinary professional (not unlike those of the drugs that vets prescribe to their patients). Those include stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout, to name a few.\nWe’ve learned that suicide and suicidal ideation remain prevalent in the profession, despite efforts from organizations such as Not One More Vet (NOMV) and others. Though we believe the situation to have improved, we currently don’t have enough research to know whether that is true.\nWe’ve also learned that these concerns exist in many countries around the world, as reported in, for example, the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. It’s important to highlight that the absence of reports in other countries does not mean the concerns do not exist, but that they were simply not reported.\n\n\n\n…but can also have perceived negative impacts on interactions with clients, teamwork, concentration, and decision-making, all of which can decrease the quality of care that patients receive.\nFrom the employers’ perspective, the veterinarians’ poor mental health and well-being increase the chances of absenteeism, attrition, and turnover, which could present significant economic costs.\nA study in 2022 estimated that the turnover and reduced working hours caused by burnout contributed to at least $1 - 2 billion in lost revenue annually in the U.S.\n\n\n\nThese “adverse mental health outcomes” have been found to be tied to occupational stressors such as long work hours, poor work-life balance, professional mistakes, unexpected outcomes, and ethical dilemmas.\nNewer studies have shown that the leadership and team environment play a pivotal role in making these stressors better or worse. For example, a focus group with veterinary technicians revealed that teams with toxic work environments also came with excessive workload, leading to burnout and staff turnover.\n\n\n\nWhile previous research has done a lot to uncover the concerns of mental health and well-being in the profession, there has been a collective shift to move away from that narrative.\nIn 2017, Cake advocated for more research that focuses on the positive aspects of veterinary work (which has always been eclipsed by the negatives in the past). A lot of veterinarians (myself included) love the profession, despite all the adverse effects that may come with it.\nPharmaceutical corporations innovate newer generations of drugs that become more effective while reducing the adverse effects. What if we could do the same for the veterinary profession? What if we can shift the newer generation of veterinarians away from these adverse effects that have been identified?\n\n\n\nAs mental wellness practices and positive psychology become more mainstream, they have spilled over into veterinarian mental health as well. With more and more studies reporting on positive outcomes such as resilience and positive functioning.\nMy team has also published research articles on meaningful work and emotional intelligence.\nAs we move forward, my hope is that we will see more research on the positive aspects of veterinary work and how we can make the profession more positive for everyone."

The first, which I wanted to share in this blog post, was that…\n\n\nSurprisingly — or perhaps unsurprisingly— talking with clients was a huge emotional stressor during their early career. One veterinarian suggested that most challenges they faced as a vet were human problems, not animal problems.\nBut when we dig deeper into the root of why talking with clients can be so stressful, we can consider that there may be internal influences (the veterinarian’s thoughts and feelings) and external influences (the clients’ actions).\n\n\n\nThese often follow situations where animals were unstable, critically ill, and/or had poor prognoses. As you can imagine, unpleasant emotions tend to build up in these situations. And, often, clients have nowhere to direct them except at the veterinarian.\nTo make matters worse, some clients have believed that since vets make so much money, they must be overcharging or gouging their prices.\nAs one veterinarian explained, there are so many non-negotiable costs that go into the cost of the surgery, for example, the surgeon, the anesthesia, the tech who monitors the anesthesia, the drugs, etc. — all these costs that many are unaware of. They concluded that the same surgery on a human would “probably be way more, like, 20 times the cost.”\nMany veterinarians described being verbally abused, threatened, and accused by clients using phrases such as “you just want my dog to die, then.” In one extreme example, the threats escalated to the point where police had to escort the client out of the clinic, creating a long-term sense of fear and emotional trauma for the veterinarian involved.\n\n\n\nMany of those accusations made by clients were also layered with an attack on the veterinarian’s character or motivation, such as “you obviously don’t care if you’re gonna refuse treatment because I can’t pay for it.”\nThese attacks can feel especially harmful to veterinarians whose careers are an integral part of their identity. One veterinarian commented, “Vets can sometimes take it really personally when a client is upset or when a case doesn’t go their way.”\nFor those at the start of their career, it can be especially hurtful. One veterinarian said, “When I was a little baby vet, I really took that to heart.” This was a tough time with tough feelings, with many sharing feelings of stress, fear, and self-doubt.\n\n\n\nSome initially found it difficult to find the sweet spot in communicating the severity and urgency of a pet’s condition. They can’t be too blunt, because it may come across as heartless. But, they can’t sugarcoat it too much, or the client may think that it’s not that serious.\nFor some, translating big medical jargon into lay terms was also challenging— which I believe might reflect the new vet’s (lack of) confidence in communication skills, since a few interviewees expressed wishing they had paid more attention to communication courses when they were in school.\nLastly, many early-career vets noticed feeling doubted or criticized when clients perceived them as the new vet. For some, it shifts their frame of thinking, and they feel the need to prove themselves. This could also compromise the quality of care, as the focus is now shifted away from treating the animal.\n\n\n\nespecially, for vets whom being a veterinarian is an integral part of their identity and vets at the beginning of their careers, who have extra hurdles to overcome.\nThe context-specific results provide great insight into the emotional toll of client interactions on veterinarians, and perhaps may even be validating to those who have experienced something similar.\n\nSee you next week for Part 2!"
